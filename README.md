# raster_max
Example script to find the indices of maximum values in a raster

# Installation

## Dependencies

This script requires Python2.7 to be installed, and to have the modules "osgeo"
and "numpy" installed so that Python2.7 can find them.

Install Python2.7: https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/
Install osgeo: "pip install osgeo" (or your package manager of choice)
Install numpy: "pip install numpy" 

Once installed, open a command line and run the script on the example tiff raster:

> $ python raster_max.py ./eg_raster.tif
